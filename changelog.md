## Changelog

* 20250208 - v1.44 a) Add Everything64.exe to ahk_group TCF4Windows; updated Everything-functions to check for Everything.exe or Everything64.exe - added notes to help tip and docs  

* 20250111 - v1.43 a) Fix: moved INI selection routine introduced in v1.42 as it interferred with selecting a (new) editor https://www.ghisler.ch/board/viewtopic.php?p=466621#p466621  
                   b) Additional hint in "Other programs" section re Hotkey to "Copy File Name(s) with Full Path"  
                   c) Added two ;@Ahk2Exe-Set* for compiled script properties (incl. AutoHotkey version)  

* 20240130 - v1.42 a) New: Enable/Disable using F4MM in Lister, Find Files and QuickView (Use elsewhere in TC)  
                      Fix: Resort to reading multiple locations in the registry + settings option to locate `wincmd.ini` to be able to read `F4Edit` setting  
                      and additional setting `INI Path`  
                      Hopefully this is now correctly handled in all cases (F4MM starts before TC, TC starts before F4MM)  

* 20240127 - v1.41 a) Fix: Check to see if TC is running in order to be able to read F4Edit= correctly (using environment variable %Commander_ini_Path%)

* 20240123 - v1.4  a) New: enable/disable F4MM for Lister and Find Files (search results) windows (see settings). If Lister setting is active and F4Edit>1 in wincmd.ini: close Lister   
                      In TC 11.03 the press "F4 to open currently viewed file in Lister" was added.  
                      (See F4Edit= options in TC help file on how to handle F4 in lister via wincmd.ini. F4TCIE _could_ be used.)

* 20231121 - v1.3  
                   a) Fix: `%N` and `%M` now processed correctly  
                   b) Added "#Requires AutoHotkey v1.1.31+" directive for users with v1 & v2 installed, added note in documention about using v1 AutoHotkey.exe in setup  

* 20231030 - v1.2  
                   a) Updated class name for Find Results control class (TMyListBox2, 32bit) for TC11  
                   b) Added: Help MsgBox-es in Settings Gui now Task Modal (32+8192=8224)

                   e) Fix: no longer require full path for programs in PATH e.g. `write.exe` v `c:\windows\write.exe`, bug introduced in v1.1 due to GetFullPathName() https://github.com/hi5/F4MiniMenu/issues/24#issuecomment-1573127847  
                   f) Fix: use SplitPath for `%p` parameter when not using TC https://github.com/hi5/F4MiniMenu/issues/24#issuecomment-1573127847  
                   g) Change: `%p` and `%t` now use wm_copydata  
                   h) New: `%N` and `%M` to place filename under the cursor into the command line (source and target directory) using wm_copydata  
                   i) New: Added support for `%$DATE%`, `%$DATE:YMD%` + offset calculations via `%$DATE:YMD|value|timeunits%`   
                   j) Fix: F4TCIE quote file path for `%file%` to resolve paths\files with spaces  
                   k) Fix: F4TCIE `Run notepad` changed to `Run %A_WinDir%\notepad.exe` to avoid any potential path issues. Added ExitApp after Run command

                   c) Build foreground menu only once vs delete/recreate (updating menu only after editing editors). Refactored menu code.  
                   d) Now use %TEMP%\$$f4mtmplist$$.m3u instead of ScriptFolder - [requested by Ovg](http://ghisler.ch/board/viewtopic.php?p=319773&sid=2e2472aec32f6906e699d095b4998ea3#319773)

* 20161023 - v0.93 OpenFile: add WinWait before WinActivate, merge request @nameanyone #10 https://github.com/hi5/F4MiniMenu/issues/10
* 20160618 - v0.92 Fix error checking on startup in case script is compiled - HT Ovg
* 20160618 - v0.91 Fix for INI Editors include (save to INI not XML when making backup). Refinement of regular expression for wildcards - HT [Ovg](http://ghisler.ch/board/viewtopic.php?p=310538#310538)
* 20160618 - v0.9 Added support for wildcards (? and *) in extensions #6 https://github.com/hi5/F4MiniMenu/issues/6. Added open delay (delay in ms between opening files)
* 20160617 - v0.83 Adding specific #include path for lib files to avoid possible error for portable users when compiling. HT [Ovg](ghisler.ch/board/viewtopic.php?p=310187#310187)
* 20151104 - v0.82 Further refinement of confusing error message at very first startup (missing configuration XML) - now also checks if BAK is present.
* 20151103 - v0.81 Fixed confusing error message at very first startup (missing configuration XML)
* 20141107 - v0.8 Added F4 functions to Lister (grabbing the filename from the Window title) and the search results in the Find Files dialog. Comment: if you use the Esc & Key as Foreground menu option it will fail as pressing Esc will close Lister and the Find Files dialog. The Winkey & Key combination does work - the menu will appear at the top of the window.
* 20140806 - v0.7 replaced Loop, object.MaxIndex() with proper for-loop to parse each key-value pair in the MatchList object; Added &letter to foreground menu options (program names)
* 20130731 - v0.61 added rudimentary backup & safety feature in case of a faulty/missing settings XML
* 20130701 - v0.6 a) [Class LV_Rows](http://www.autohotkey.com/board/topic/94364-class-lv-rows-copy-cut-paste-and-drag-listviews/) by [Pulover](https://github.com/Pulover/) replaces [LV_MoveRow()](http://www.autohotkey.com/board/topic/56396-techdemo-move-rows-in-a-listview/). 
                     This resolves the problem with the listview not updating icons while moving the editors in the settings Gui;
                  b) Added Unicode support for drag & drop method so F4MiniMenu should now be compatible with both Ansi and Unicode versions of AutoHotkey.
* 20130607 - v0.51 Check if selected file(s) are archived, if so bypass F4MiniMenu all together and use internal TC Edit command to open file, this will only use the file under the cursor, not all selected files.
* 20130330 - v0.5 a) Process entire file list first and open per program; 
                  b) Introduced [Filelist](readme.md#filelist) method; 
                  c) Removed "Open Mode".
* 20121117 - v0.4 Configuration GUIs, tray menu. First editor now considered default editor.
* 20121111 - v0.3 Added menu for "foreground" feature - open all selected files with specific editor (its behaviour may change in future).
* 20121108 - v0.2 Added 0 (zero) entry in XML as default editor.
* 20121101 - v0.1 Initial very basic version.
